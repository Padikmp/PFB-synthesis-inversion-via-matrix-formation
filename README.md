PFB_reconstruction -> Initial verification that the synthesis model worked via sine wave testing
channelise_example -> Visual demonstration of how channelisation works
synth_FIR_matrix -> Takes PFB_reconstruction code, runs FIR loop testing each impulse pos #, and builds a synthesis matrix from least squares regression using that data
synth_sine_test -> Compares original and matrix reconstruction using sine wave
